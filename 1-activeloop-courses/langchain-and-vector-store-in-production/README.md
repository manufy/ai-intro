# ActiveLoop LangChain & Vector Databases in Production course

The course is using OpenAI, but I opted to use HuggingFace endpoints instead because:

    - local running time for models like ollama was too large in my machine
    - I wanted to avoid OpenAI running costs
    - It will help to make quick experiments with a great variety of AI models
