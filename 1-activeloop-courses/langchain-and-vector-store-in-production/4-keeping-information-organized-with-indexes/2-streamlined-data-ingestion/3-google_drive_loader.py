#Â To set up the credentials_file, follow these steps:
# Create a new Google Cloud Platform project or use an existing one by visiting the Google Cloud Console. Ensure that billing is enabled for your project.
# Enable the Google Drive API by navigating to its dashboard in the Google Cloud Console and clicking "Enable."
# Create a service account by going to the Service Accounts page in the Google Cloud Console. Follow the prompts to set up a new service account.
# Assign necessary roles to the service account, such as "Google Drive API - Drive File Access" and "Google Drive API - Drive Metadata Read/Write Access," depending on your needs.
# After creating the service account, access the "Actions" menu next to it, select "Manage keys," click "Add Key," and choose "JSON" as the key type. This generates a JSON key file and downloads it to your computer, which serves as your credentials_file.
# Retrieve the folder or document ID from the URL:
# Folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/{folder_id}
# Document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/{document_id}/edit
